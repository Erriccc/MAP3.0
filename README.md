## About Map3.0

Map 3.0 is simply provides cryptocurrency users and vendors a platform to find each other  trade transact between tokens with fewer intermediaries and cheap transaction fees

review ranks will be used to reward the best vendors per /week/month when reward programs are open
review ranks will be reset every week/moth with the hep of chainlink keepers
## Getting Started

```

first run the development server:

```bash
npm install 
# or
yarn add
```

next, start the hardhat local node, note  the tests require a fork of the mainnet so you need your json rpc provider in hardhat config


```bash
npx hardhat node
```
next deploy scripts and run custom script to impersonate and grap tokens from the mainnet, make sure to switch TargetAccount in scripts/contracts-deploy-script.js to the account where you want the funds sent to
```bash
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/contracts-deploy-script.js
```

then start your front end
```bash
yarn next dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/_app.js`. make sure to create your .env file and inculde your evm node url.
